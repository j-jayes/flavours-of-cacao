# Flavours of Cacao

## Purpose

Ingest, tidy, describe, analyse and model data from the cacao reviews website [Flavors of Cacao](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html).

Plan is to make:

- a map based on the average scores
- a density plot based on the top 10 most popular countries. 
- use the Corrr package to do a correlation of the different variables. 
- use lasso reg to model the words which are most associated with high scores.
- will turn this into a tutorial.

## Process

Getting going on ingest and tidy.
